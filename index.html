  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently a senior at Purdue University majoring in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering with a focus in Astrodynamics. My academic interests include orbital mechanics, guidance & navigation, and launch vehicle trajectory design. I am very passionate about the growing space industry and the mission to send people to Mars and explore the Universe! Some of my other hobbies include being a passionate Philidelphia sports fan, competing on the Lacrosse field, and

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Subaru of Indiana Automotive, Inc.</b> <br>
        Manufacturing Engineering Intern (Energy Efficiency Projects) <br> <br>
        
        During the summer of 2025, I had the great opportunity to work at SIA. I was a Mechanical Engineering
        Administrator with the Plant Planning group. The groups focused were on Energy Sustainability and plant
        planning. During the course of the summer I was able to successfully provide work and research towards
        these focuses. Here are some projects I worked on: <br> <br>

        Investiagting retrofitting a part of the plant for energy regeneration.<br>
        - Finding estimates and creating an 11 x 7 " one-page presentable for company negotiations<br>
        - Providing electrical contractors with a one-page specification sheet for a request for quote<br>
        for a network connection cable installation as a part of a solar panel installation. 
        - Taking electrical contractors through a walkthrough, attaining quotes, and assisting in the
        process for submitting a Purchasing Order.<br>
        - Creating AutoCAD layouts for proposed projects and comparing them with the systems currently in 
        the plant<br>

        Overall, I learned about the flow of the workplace environment, engineering and 
        business processes in projects, and effective communication and organization skills.<br>

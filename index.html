  <!-- ===== ABOUT ===== -->
  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently a senior at Purdue University majoring in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering with a focus in Astrodynamics. 
      My academic interests include orbital mechanics, guidance & navigation, and launch vehicle trajectory design. In addition to these aerospace
      interests, I am also highly motivated by the use of computer science and software in engineering. I am very passionate about the growing space 
      industry and the mission to send people to Mars and explore the Universe! Some of my other hobbies include being a passionate Philidelphia sports 
      fan, competing on the Lacrosse field, and other outdoor activities such as star gazing, hiking, and biking. I am seeking a full time role in the aerospace 
      industry for after I graduate school and am very excited to start contributing to the high levels of engineering in the work force.

  <!-- ===== EXPERIENCE ===== -->
  <section id="experience">
    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <b><h3>Subaru of Indiana Automotive, Inc.</h3></b>

    Manufacturing Engineering Summer Intern. June 2nd - August 22nd<br>
  
    During the summer of 2025, I had the great opportunity to work at SIA. I was a Mechanical Engineering
    Administrator with the Plant Planning group. The group's focuses were on Energy Sustainability and Plant
    Planning. During the course of the summer I was able to successfully provide work and research towards
    these focuses. <br>
    Here are some projects I worked on: <br> 
    <ul>
        <li>Investigating retrofitting a part of the plant for energy regeneration.</li>
        <li>Finding estimates and creating an 11 x 7 " one-page presentable for company negotiations </li>
        <li>Providing electrical contractors with a one-page specification sheet for a request for quote
        for a network connection cable installation as a part of a solar panel installation. </li>
        <li>Taking electrical contractors through a walkthrough, attaining quotes, and assisting in the
        process for submitting a Purchasing Order.</li>
        <li>Creating AutoCAD layouts for proposed projects and comparing them with the systems currently in 
        the plant</li><br>
    </ul>
    Technical Experience gained:
    <ul>
      <li>Subaru horizontally opposed boxer engine teardown and build up</li>
      <li>Better understanding into engine to drivetrain to tires Torque and Power translation</li>
      <li>Electrical Components- Research into electrical motors, electromagnetic clutches, encoders, Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs), and more.</li>
      <li>Mechanical Components- Research into Pulley and belt specs, and mechanical coupling options.</li>
      
    </ul>
        Overall, I learned about the flow of the workplace environment, engineering and 
        business processes in projects, and effective communication and organization skills. This experience
        will serve as an anchor for my career as move forward after school.<br>

  <!-- ===== Clubs ===== -->
  <section id="Clubs">
    <h2>Clubs</h2>
    
    <h3>Purdue MCLA Division I Club Lacrosse</h3>
    <p> August 2023 - Current </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Practice 3+ times a week in the fall and spring semesters</li>
      <li> Compete with other college teams in the local area during the fall</li>
      <li> Travel nationally in the Spring to compete in Tournaments</li>
      <li> Volunteer as a team in the local Tippecanoe County area</li>
    </ul>

    <p> Being a part of this team has been pivital towards my development during college. It allows me to continue
    pursing my passion for lacrosse, while also giving me a well needed break from my studies during the week. It has stimulated 
    my social life by providing me friends to have fun with and compete with at the highest levels. </p>

    <h3>Purdue SLING Research Graduate Club</h3> <p> February 2025 - Current</p>
    <ul>
      <li>SLING: Space-Loving Individuals Negotiating Gravity</li>
      <li>Study orbital dynamics and control in the Cis-lunar environment using an iteration of the Circular Restricted Three Body Problem</li>
      <li>Work with the Controls sub-team to study indirect optimal control solutions for spacecraft an simulate complex non-linear dynamics</li>
      <li>Utilized Taylor approximation to compute a Jacobian for linearized dynamics to find closed orbits about a specific equilibrium point</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Purdue Astronomy Club</h3>
    <p>August 2024 - Current</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Club dedicated to star gazing and learning about the universe</li>

   <!-- ===== SKILLS ===== -->
  <section id="skills">
    <h2>Software Skills</h2>
    <h3>SIA Internship Skills</h3>
    <li>AutoCAD- Took a preliminary course in AutoCAD to start my internship. Following this, during the entire summer
    I had many tasks that involved modeling different layouts that existed in the plant, or were propoesd in AutoCAD. Additionally,
    I was tasked to make chagnes and create different potential options for existing large AutoCAD files for the plant.</li>
    <li>Other CAD- During my internship at SIA I also briefly used SolidWorks. From College and High School I also have experience
    in NX, OnShape, and Inventor. I feel very comfortable with these CAD softwares, and confident that I can pick up any CAD
    software that I don't have experience with.</li>
    <li>Free Flyer- This is a space mission analysis software that I used during one of my classes at Purdue. I used it to
    contruct orbits, study perturbations, and understand data trends.</li>
    <li>XFLR5- This is an aerodynamics analysis software that I used for another one of my classes at Purdue. It was used to 
    analyze low speed flow over airfoils, study 3-Dimensional wing affects, and look at aircraft stability theory.</li>
    <li>MATLAB- I have extensive experience in MATLAB from nearly all of my classes at Purdue. I have used it for complex data
    analysis, numerical integration, and simulation and graphing. Specifically I have been able to used it in my aerospace
    classes to simulate attitude dynamics, orbital mechanics, dynamics and statics, and statistical analysis.</li>
    <li>Other Programming Languages- I have experience with Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, C++. I have taken additionally
    classes outside of my main Aerospace major in Computer Science classes in order to refine these skills. During these
    I have also gathered exposure to discrete mathematics.</li>

    <h3>Soft Skills</h3>
    <li>Project leadership- </li>
    <li>Presentational Speaking</li>
    <li>Organizational Skills</li>
